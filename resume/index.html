  <p>I run <a href="https://sslip.io/">sslip.io</a>, a DNS service which maps specially-crafted hostnames to IP
  addresses.</p>

  <p>I also run six servers in the <a href="https://www.ntppool.org/user/cunnie">NTP pool</a> which carry an aggregate
  of 1% of the US NTP pool traffic (my Singapore server carries an even higher percentage).</p>

  <p>I am the maintainer of several BOSH releases that support my abiding interest in DNS, NTP, and HTTP: <a href=
  "https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/pdns-release">PowerDNS</a>, <a href=
  "https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/ntp-release">NTP</a>, and <a href=
  "https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-release">nginx</a>.</p>

  <p>I (with Dmitriy Kalinin) added <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/guide-ipv6-on-vsphere/">IPv6 support to BOSH</a>.</p>

  <p>I <a href="https://github.com/cunnie?tab=contributions">contribute</a> to open source projects. My favorite
  contribution: updating Ruby's core library, openssl, to <a href=
  "https://github.com/ruby/openssl/commit/9322a104d16b02c7a79f9ab589859c9d63fabf52">correctly verify abbreviated IPv6
